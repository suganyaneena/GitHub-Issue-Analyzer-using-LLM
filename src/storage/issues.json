      "body": "In react-reconciler, the `flushSync` export was renamed to `flushSyncFromReconciler` in PR #28500 (merged April 8, 2024). This is an undocumented breaking change for custom renderers.\n\n**Commit:** https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28500\n\nAccording to that PR, custom renderers should now use:\n- `reconciler.updateContainerSync()` - to update synchronously\n- `reconciler.flushSyncWork()` - to flush pending sync work\n\nHowever, this migration path is not documented anywhere for custom renderer authors. The change silently causes `flushSync` to be `undefined` with no warning.\n\n**0.29.x API:**\n```js\nconst reconciler = ReactReconciler(hostConfig)\nconst { flushSync } = reconciler  // works\n\n// Usage\nflushSync(() => {\n  reconciler.updateContainer(element, container, null, callback)\n})\n```\n\n**0.31.0+ API:**\n```js\nconst reconciler = ReactReconciler(hostConfig)\nconst { flushSync } = reconciler  // undefined!\n\n// New intended usage (undocumented):\nreconciler.updateContainerSync(element, container, null, callback)\nreconciler.flushSyncWork()\n```\n\nCould we please:\n1. Document the new API for custom renderers in the react-reconciler README\n2. Or add a deprecation warning when accessing the old `flushSync` property\n\nThis affects custom renderers like @opentui/react that were following the previous patterns.",

      "title": "Bug: resolveLazy catching promises causes race condition with short-lived Suspense-wrapped components",
      "body": "## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a React Server Component with a short async delay (~5ms) wrapped in Suspense\n2. Trigger a revalidation (e.g., via revalidatePath() in Next.js)\n3. The server sends correct updated data, but the client UI does not update\n\nLink to code example: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/87529\n\n## The current behavior\n\nAfter calling revalidatePath(), the browser receives the correct Flight data with the updated counter value, but the UI remains stuck showing the old value. This only happens:\n- In production mode\n- With short async delays (~5ms)\n- When the component is wrapped in Suspense\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85e3ccaa-75af-4bed-859e-972c30e50904\n\nThe issue was introduced in commit that upgraded React from `eaee5308-20250728` to `9be531cd-20250729`.\n\n## Root cause\n\nThe new resolveLazy function in ReactChildFiber.js catches promises and throws SuspenseException:\n\n```ts\nexport function resolveLazy<T>(lazyType: LazyComponentType<T, any>): T {\n  try {\n    if (__DEV__) {\n      return callLazyInitInDEV(lazyType);\n    }\n    const payload = lazyType._payload;\n    const init = lazyType._init;\n    return init(payload);\n  } catch (x) {\n    if (x !== null && typeof x === 'object' && typeof x.then === 'function') {\n      // This lazy Suspended. Treat this as if we called use() to unwrap it.\n      suspendedThenable = x;\n      if (__DEV__) {\n        needsToResetSuspendedThenableDEV = true;\n      }\n      throw SuspenseException;\n    }\n    throw x;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen a lazy component's init() throws a short-lived promise (~5ms), this creates a race condition:\n1. resolveLazy catches the promise and stores it in suspendedThenable\n2. It throws SuspenseException to signal suspension\n3. The promise resolves before React has finished setting up its subscription\n4. React remains suspended, waiting for a signal that already passed\n5. The UI never updates\n\n## Previous working version\n\n```ts\nfunction resolveLazy(lazyType: any) {\n  if (__DEV__) {\n    return callLazyInitInDEV(lazyType);\n  }\n  const payload = lazyType._payload;\n  const init = lazyType._init;\n  return init(payload);\n}\n```\n\nWithout the try-catch, promises propagate naturally through React's existing Suspense machinery, which handles them correctly.\n\nThe expected behavior\n\nAfter revalidatePath() is called:\n1. The server sends updated Flight data\n2. React reconciles the new data\n3. The UI updates to show the new counter value",

      "body": "Since React 19, nested providers for the same context will lead to unnecessary render calls for some scenarios. I wrote a unit test and confirmed that React 18.3.1 behaves as expected.\n\nE.g. for the following pseudo-code React component structure:\n```tsx\n<SomeContextProvider>\n  <SomeContextConsumer>\n    <SomeContextProvider>\n      <SomeContextConsumer />\n    </SomeContextProvider>\n  </SomeContextConsumer>\n</SomeContextProvider>\n```\nIf the value provided by the outer SomeContextProvider changes, the innermost SomeContextConsumer will also be rendered. (Actually it will only \"semi-render\", because even though the function is called, the result is ignored.)\n\nIt is probably only an unnecessary detail for most users, but for me it broke some tests which track every single render for performance reasons and it actually causes >1k unnecessary component function calls in some situations because I utilize some nested contexts for some widely used information where it is important that elements are only rerendered when the context value changes. So if the top-level context provider is updated, but another provider between the element and it is not updated, the element should not be rendered.  \nAlso, it is very concerning that it executes the component function but ignores the result.\n\nReact version: 19.2.3 (and 19.0.0)\nWorks in 18.3.1\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Open code example below. Execute `vitest` in terminal.\n  - The test will fail, because the component was kind of rendered, even though it was unnecessary.\n2. Downgrade to React 18.3.1 by updating package.json and running `npm install`\n3. Execute `vitest` in terminal. The test will pass.\n\nLink to code example:\n\n[Repro code in unit test on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitest-tests-browser-examples-akwsn1xm?file=tests%2Freact19ContextsBugMinimalReprodWithUnitTest.test.tsx)\n\n## The current behavior\nThe inner component consuming the React context is called, even though the context value has not changed for it.\n\n## The expected behavior\nLike in React 18.3.1: Only component functions where the context value has changed will be called.",

      "body": "# react-hooks ESLint plugin rules are extremely slow, dominating lint time\n\n- React version: `react@19.2.3`\n- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` version: `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@7.0.1`\n- `eslint` version: `eslint@9.39.1`\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Install `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (the React Compiler ESLint plugin)\n2. Enable the recommended plugin rules: e.g. `reactHooksPlugin.configs.flat.recommended, jstsFiles`\n3. Run ESLint with `TIMING=50` on a large codebase (~15k+ files)\n4. Observe that `react-hooks/static-components` takes 42-56% of total lint time\n\n## Link to code example\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot share a minimal reproduction as this occurs on a large proprietary codebase. However, the performance data should be reproducible on any sufficiently large React codebase.\n\n## The current behavior\n\nWhen running ESLint with the `TIMING` flag on our codebase, the `react-hooks` plugin rules dominate lint time:\n\n```\nRule                                       |  Time (ms) | Relative\n:------------------------------------------|-----------:|--------:\nreact-hooks/static-components              | 393394.236 |    56.2%\nunused-imports/no-unused-imports           |  62579.162 |     8.9%\nredos-detector/no-unsafe-regex             |  35114.790 |     5.0%\nimport/named                               |  24641.617 |     3.5%\nreact-hooks/rules-of-hooks                 |  16596.903 |     2.4%\n...\n```\n\n**Key findings:**\n- `react-hooks/static-components` takes **~393 seconds** (6.5 minutes) — more than **5x longer** than the next slowest rule\n- The react-hooks plugin nearly **doubles total lint time**: ~3 minutes without the plugin vs ~6 minutes with it enabled\n- With 4x parallelism (`--concurrency=4`), total ESLint time goes from ~190 seconds to ~370 seconds when the plugin is enabled\n- Even if we disable `react-hooks/static-components`, another rule jumps up to take the top spot. It seems to trigger from the plugin itself, not any particular rule.\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nThe `react-hooks` rules should have comparable performance to other ESLint rules. A single rule taking 42-56% of total lint time and being 5x slower than any other rule suggests there may be optimization opportunities in the rule implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Impact:** This performance issue significantly affects CI pipeline times and local development experience. We're considering running these rules as a separate parallel step or disabling them entirely, which isn't ideal.",

The code defines a factory function createBindings() that returns React components. Inside the factory:\n    - InnerComponent is defined as a simple functional component\n    - OuterComponent uses InnerComponent inside a .map() callback\n  3. Observe the compiled output - the .map() callback is extracted to a module-scope function _temp:\n```ts\n  function _temp(item) {\n    console.log(\"InnerComponent:\", typeof InnerComponent);\n    return <InnerComponent key={item} value={item} />;\n  }\n```\n  4. _temp references InnerComponent, but InnerComponent is defined inside createBindings() - not at module scope.\n  The closure is broken.\n  5. At runtime, InnerComponent is undefined inside _temp, causing: Error: InnerComponent is not defined\n\n  Expected behavior:\n\n  The compiler should either:\n  - Keep the callback inline to preserve the closure\n  - Hoist captured variables along with the extracted function\n  - Skip compilation for callbacks that close over locally-scoped values\n\n  Workaround:\n\n  Adding 'use no memo' to OuterComponent prevents the callback extraction and preserves the closure.\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.2.0\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n1.0.0",

Configure a React app to run React Compiler.\n2. Create a component named `Symbol`.\n3. Run the app.\n\nThe issue relates to the fact that React Compiler generates output with a call to `Symbol.for`. As shown in the playground link, if a component is in scope with the name `Symbol`, the compiler-generated code tries to call the `for` method on the React component rather than `globalThis.Symbol`.

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\nSuspense fallback is not rendered during SSR when the root component lacks top-level `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` tags. The server buffers the entire response until all suspended promises resolve, preventing streaming and the rendering of the initial fallback content.\n\nThis behavior impacts a use case where the React component is rendered as a sub-tree to be integrated into a larger application that uses a different framework.\n\nThis [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/b25bcd460f98a0b89e5a7199a6c88112163d961f) introduced this behavior change in the streaming logic where it worked in 19.0.0.\n\nReact version: 19.1-19.2\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.

The generated HTML for the suspended component only contains the resolved content wrapped in the standard suspense boundary markers:\n\n```html\n<!--$--><h1>Hello</h1><!--/$-->\n```\n\nNo fallback content (i.e., the \"Loading...\" message) is rendered to the client.\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nThe`Loading...` fallback should be rendered, mirroring the correct behavior observed in the full-document rendering path:\n\n```html\n<!--$-->\n<!--$?-->\n<template id=\"B:0\"></template>\nLoading...\n<!--/$-->\n<!--/$-->\n<script id=\"_R_\">\n  ...\n</script>\n<div hidden id=\"S:0\">\n  <h1>Hello</h1>\n</div>\n<script>\n  ...\n</script>\n```\nComparison Path: https://3c4mqn-8080.csb.app/\n",

For example:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Component({ foo, bar }) {\n\tif (!foo && !bar) {\n\t\tfoo = \"foo\";\n\t}\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t{Array.from({ length: 3 }, (_, i) => <div key={i}>{foo}</div>)}\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nI got this error:\n> Todo: Support destructuring of context variables\n\nYou can also replace the if statement `if (!foo && !bar) { foo = \"foo\"; }` with the content itself `foo = \"foo\";`, that will also trigger the issue, however it is meaningless.\n\nThe modified prop must in a callback, directly use it will work fine. For example, `<div>{foo}</div>` works fine, and `<div>{(() => foo)()}</div>` raise an issue.\n\nI think the code above should be automatically converted into the code below which can work properly. Although I can also use the code below directly, it will only cause more trouble.\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Component({ foo: _foo, bar }) {\n\tlet foo = _foo;\n\tif (!foo && !bar) {\n\t\tfoo = \"foo\";\n\t}\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t{Array.from({ length: 3 }, (_, i) => <div key={i}>{foo}</div>)}\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.2.1\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n1.0.0",

[Per the React Compiler v1.0 announcement](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/07/react-compiler-1#migrating-from-eslint-plugin-react-compiler-to-eslint-plugin-react-hooks), I removed eslint-plugin-react-compiler, bumped eslint-plugin-react-hooks to the latest version (7.0.1), and made the eslint config changes accordingly. All other rules, including the new ones, seem to work as expected, except this one seems to have disappeared (I only noticed because our codebase has many instances of this that we've been planning to fix at some point before enabling the compiler). Is this a bug or is this no longer meant to throw a lint error, since it does [explicitly break the rules of React](https://react.dev/reference/rules/react-calls-components-and-hooks#never-pass-around-hooks-as-regular-values) ? \n\n## The current behavior\n<img width=\"898\" height=\"317\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90110fe0-a571-4aee-b863-4e7968dc9b1b\" />\n\n## The expected behavior\n<img width=\"898\" height=\"317\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ca533cf-44ce-42d5-a8b1-25760123173b\" />",

      "body": "### Website or app\n\nhttps://github.com/mukesharyal/react-devtools-bug-report\n\n### Repro steps\n\n1. Clone the GitHub repo and run `npm install`\n2. Run the local dev server with `npm run dev` and also run React Devtools\n3. You will see two components `ComponentA` and `ComponentB`\n4. Cause a re-render of `ComponentA` by clicking the button a bunch of times\n5. `ComponentB` will also be shown in the component render highlights and `Profiler` sessions\n\nThe structure of `App` component looks like this:\n\n```\nimport ComponentA from './components/ComponentA';\nimport ComponentB from './components/ComponentB';\n\nfunction App() {\n\n\treturn(\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentA />\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentB />\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThis is what `ComponentA` looks like:\n\n```\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function ComponentA()\n{\n    console.log(\"Component A rendered!\");\n\n    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n    return(\n        \n        <>\n            <h1>\n                Component A\n            </h1>\n               \n            <h2>\n                Count is {count}\n            </h2>\n\n            <button onClick={() => { setCount(count => count + 1) }}>\n                Increase Count\n            </button>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is `ComponentB`:\n\n```\nexport default function ComponentB()\n{\n    console.log(\"Component B rendered!\");\n\n    return(\n        <>\n            <h1>\n                Component B\n            </h1>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n```\n\nNow, when I re-render `ComponentA` by clicking the button a bunch of times, I see re-render highlights in `ComponentA`. But, the surprising part is that I also see highlights in `ComponentB`.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n<img width=\"597\" height=\"297\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/806fdfe3-7132-481c-a664-31302019ef2f\" />\n\nAnd here is a `Profiler` session I recorded:\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"406\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed397760-ad82-407f-aa25-acf6d9699489\" />\n\nIt clearly shwos that `ComponentB` also \"re-rendered\" a bunch of times, and it actually took **more time** to \"re-render\" `ComponentB` than `ComponentA`.\n\nAnd here is what the console logs look like:\n\n<img width=\"1109\" height=\"843\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71a14be-6288-4004-9d88-3033d6f021c1\" />\n\nAnd indeed, like we expect, there is only the console log when `ComponentB` rendered the first time and not again. But, the `Profiler` session and the component render highlights say otherwise.\n\nNow, let's change the structure of `App` component just a little bit:\n\n```\nimport ComponentA from './components/ComponentA';\nimport ComponentB from './components/ComponentB';\n\nfunction App() {\n\n\treturn(\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentA />\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<ComponentB />\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nAnd now let's see the component highlights and `Profiler` session.\n\nHere is the highlights now:\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"563\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a33dfe-8e73-4c0b-8521-b4ef1e6b2a96\" />\n\nAnd here is what the `Profiler` says:\n\n<img width=\"1018\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51236cf3-f29e-4fd9-bfe7-4b3cb497e288\" />\n\nSo, now the results are what we expect.\n\nThis project was made with `React 19`, but we also see the same things with `React 18` as well. And, the presence or absence of the `React Compiler` makes no difference.\n\nTo verify that the effects are not seen with composition, I made a simple `Wrapper` component and had the same `div`s wrap our components as before. Here is the `Wrapper`:\n\n```\nexport default function Wrapper({ children })\n{\n    return(\n        <div>\n            { children }\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n```\n\nAnd now, we use the `Wrapper` instead of `div`s in our `App` component like this:\n\n```\nimport Wrapper from './components/Wrapper';\n\nimport ComponentA from './components/ComponentA';\nimport ComponentB from './components/ComponentB';\n\nfunction App() {\n\n\treturn(\n\n\t\t<Wrapper>\n\n\t\t\t<Wrapper>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentA />\n\t\t\t</Wrapper>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<Wrapper>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentB />\n\t\t\t</Wrapper>\n\n\t\t</Wrapper>\n\t);\n\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThankfully, we do not see the weird behavior in this case. Sigh!\n\nSo after all this, we clearly see that the weird stuffs are only seen in a specific case where we are using `div`s before the composition for layout purposes.\n\nBut, I do think that this is not at all \"expected React behavior\". Either this is a bug with the React library itself, or the React Devtools are lying to us.\n\nSo, that was the weird thing I saw. I have also written a blog post where I discuss this same thing in more detail. It can be found [here](https://www.mukesharyal.com.np/blog/on-react-reconciliation/).\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### DevTools package (automated)\n\n_No response_\n\n### DevTools version (automated)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Error message (automated)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Error call stack (automated)\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Error component stack (automated)\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### GitHub query string (automated)\n\n```text\n\n```",

Wrap a lazy-loaded component inside <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>.\n2. Simulate a slow network response (2–5 seconds delay).\n3. Observe multiple re-renders of the fallback UI in the console.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe fallback component should ideally render once and remain stable until the\nlazy component resolves.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe fallback re-renders several times durin\n",

      "body": "### Description\nI observed that the cleanup function inside `useEffect` does not always trigger when\nthere are rapid, consecutive state updates. This leads to stale subscriptions and\nunexpected behavior in components that rely on cleanup.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a component with a useEffect that logs cleanup.\n2. Trigger state updates inside a loop or with very small intervals (5–10ms).\n3. Observe that cleanup logs are skipped or delayed.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nCleanup should run reliably before every re-invocation of the effect, regardless of\nhow fast state is updated.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nCleanup is inconsistently triggered during extremely fast re-renders.\n\n### Version\n- React: Latest main branch\n- Environment: Browser (Chrome/Edge)\n- OS: Windows 10 / macOS (tested both)\n\n### Additional Info\nIssue seems more noticeable in strict mode, possibly due to double rendering behavior.\n",
